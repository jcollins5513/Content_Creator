# Granular Plan: Phase 6 - UI Debugging & End-to-End Testing

This plan details the tasks for debugging remaining UI issues and then performing end-to-end testing of the application, as part of **Phase 6: Finalization & Deployment** from `master-plan.md`.

---

## Tasks for Next Session

- **1. UI Error Debugging:**
  - Review the current UI and identify the specific error(s) occurring.
  - Inspect browser console logs and network requests for clues.
  - Examine relevant frontend component code (`Dashboard.tsx`, `App.tsx`, panel components, CSS files) to find the root cause.
  - Implement necessary fixes to resolve the UI errors.
  - Verify the UI displays correctly without errors.

- **2. Backend Testing:**
  - Verify all API endpoints are functioning as expected (media uploads, media listing, calendar auth, calendar events).
  - Test token persistence and refresh mechanisms for Google OAuth.
  - Confirm error handling and input validation are robust.

- **2. Frontend Testing:**
  - Test the dashboard layout and responsiveness (if applicable).
  - Verify media player functionality: upload, display images, play videos.
  - Test calendar panel: Google login, event fetching, and display.
  - Test any functionality in the 'New Feature' panel (if implemented).
  - Check for console errors or warnings in the browser.

- **3. Integrated Testing (Frontend + Backend):**
  - Perform full user flows (e.g., login, upload media, view media, view calendar).
  - Test interactions between frontend panels and backend services.
  - Verify data consistency between frontend and backend.

- **4. Cross-Browser/Device Testing (Optional, if applicable):**
  - If targeting specific browsers or devices, test compatibility.

- **5. Bug Reporting and Fixing:**
  - Document any bugs found with clear steps to reproduce.
  - Prioritize and address critical bugs.


We are in Phase 6: Finalization & Deployment. Before proceeding to end-to-end testing, we need to address a lingering UI error. The [granular-plan.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/justi/projects/Content_Creator/granular-plan.md:0:0-0:0) has been updated to reflect this.

Please start by helping me debug the UI. We need to:
1. Review the current UI and identify the specific error(s) occurring.
2. Inspect browser console logs and network requests for clues.
3. Examine relevant frontend component code ([Dashboard.tsx](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/justi/projects/Content_Creator/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx:0:0-0:0), [App.tsx](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/justi/projects/Content_Creator/frontend/src/App.tsx:0:0-0:0), panel components, CSS files) to find the root cause.
4. Implement necessary fixes to resolve the UI errors.
5. Verify the UI displays correctly without errors.

Once the UI error is resolved, we will move on to backend testing as previously planned.
