1. Create `master-plan.md` based on the user's prompt and desired project scope.
2. Divide the plan into **clear, modular sections** (e.g., "Content Engine", "Showroom Display", "Dashboard").
3. Lock this file from future structural edits â€” it will be the **single source of truth**.
4. Create `granular-plan.md`, scoped to the **first section** of the `master-plan.md`.
