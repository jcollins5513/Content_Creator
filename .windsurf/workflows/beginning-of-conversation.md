description: The start of each conversation

At the start of every new session:
1. Review `master-plan.md` to identify the **next unchecked section**.
2. Create or refresh `granular-plan.md` to focus on that section, with detailed subtasks.
3. Maintain modular focus â€” the `granular-plan.md` should reflect only the **current section** being developed.
